# Functions

### Always uppercase

All functions to be written in uppercase

```sql
COALESCE()
LAG()
LEAD()
ROW_NUMBER()
CURRENT_DATE()
ARRAY_AGG()
SUM()
NULLIF()
```

### User-defined Functions

This is a place where two rules meet togeter. User-defined functions are man-made object but they're also a function. In order to prioritise their functional purpose, we write them in uppercase.

```sql
CONVERT_TIME_TO_DATE_TZ()
GET_COUNTRY_CODE_FROM_LOCALE()
REPLACE_DIACRITICS()
GET_NAME_FROM_URL()
```
